Gender and Age Prediction using Deep Learning

Introduction:

In an era dominated by computer vision and artificial intelligence, predicting demographic information from visual data has gained significant traction. One fascinating application is the prediction of gender and age based on facial images. This project presents a deep learning model that aims to predict an individual's gender and age simultaneously using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-task learning.

About:

This project is a multi-task gender and age prediction model that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict the gender and age of individuals based on facial images. It utilizes a dataset of facial images with corresponding age and gender labels to train a deep learning model.

The key components of this project include data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the development of a multi-input neural network. The neural network consists of two branches, one for processing the facial images and another for handling age information. The model is trained to simultaneously predict gender and age, making it a multi-task learning problem.

The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the project includes the visualization of results through confusion matrices and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) analysis.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset of facial images, including images from different age groups and genders.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Feature Extraction: Utilized pre-trained CNN models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from facial images.

Model Architecture: Developed a multi-input neural network with two branches: one for processing facial images and another for age information. These branches are connected to a final set of dense layers for prediction.

Training: Trained the model using the prepared dataset, implementing multi-task loss functions to jointly predict gender and age.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualized results with confusion matrices and AUC-ROC curves.

Results:

The model demonstrated promising results in predicting both gender and age from facial images. It achieved competitive accuracy and performed well across different age groups and genders.

Conclusion:

This project highlights the power of deep learning and multi-task learning in predicting demographic information from facial images. The simultaneous prediction of gender and age showcases the versatility and practicality of this approach. Future work could involve refining the model architecture, exploring larger and more diverse datasets, and expanding the application of such models in real-world scenarios.
